\begin{abstract}
In this report we summarize our efforts to replicate the data filtration process described in Appendix B of \textit{The Puzzle of Index Option Returns} by \citet{constantinides2013}. These filters shape the underlying distribution of implied volatility (``IV'') and moneyness for a large cross-section of SPX index options (1 million+), and were used to build and price 54 option portfolios. Due to the unavailability of SPX option data from 1985 to 1995, we focus our analysis on replicating the filtration results OptionMetrics data from \STARTONE\  to \ENDONE. We then apply these filters to more recent data from \STARTTWO\  to \ENDTWO. Through a sequence of data visualizations, we show that while the paper's intricately constructed data filters may yield elegant results when applied to one time period, these results do not necessarily port over to other time periods. The implications for option pricing models based on such time-fragile data filters would be an interesting follow-up study. Our detailed analysis and code can be readily found on \href{https://tinyurl.com/3psws69d}{Github}\footnote{ \url{https://tinyurl.com/3psws69d}}.

\section{Replicating Table B1}

Appendix B of \citet{constantinides2013} outlines three levels of filters applied to millions of SPX call and put options with an intent to minimize quoting errors in the construction of the paper's 54 option portfolios. In this report we will summarize our implementation, and briefly discuss the challenges and differences encountered in our attempted replication and the subsequent reproduction for a later time period. Our results are summarized in \autoref{table:tableB1}. 

\subsection{Level 1 Filters} 


\paragraph{Methodology}

The Level 1 filters comprised of an ``Identical'' filter, to filter out duplicate options in the OptionMetrics data (measured by identical option type, strike, expiration date, and price), and an ``Identical Except Price'' filter (the ``IEP filter''), which aimed to filter out options identical in all respects except price. In these cases, the paper's authors retained options whose quoted T-bill-based IV was closest to its moneyness neighbors, and deleted the rest.

\paragraph{Commentary on Results}

Two issues arose when applying this set of filters. First, there were quite a few options in the IEP filter that have no reported IV. While this was not explicitly addressed in the paper's description of the Level 1 filters, it created an issue with replication because the T-bill-based IV was required to identify the nearest moneyness neighbors. The missing IV option count here was limited to about 5 in the 1996-2012 dataset, but in the 2012-2019 dataset we observed 355,896 options with no reported IV. For the purpose of this filter, if an IV was not reported, it was not chosen as the option with IV closest to the at the money. Additionally, if an option group's ``at the money'' member could not have their IV calculated by numerical methods (described later in this report), all options in that group would be subsequently dropped via the ``Unable to compute IV'' filter. 

Second, an unexplainable difference occurred upon the application of the Volume = 0 filter. In Table B1 of \citet{constantinides2013}, no options have a Volume = 0 in their dataset. However, we observed over two millions options with a Volume = 0. Unfortunately, no more details were given in the manuscript describing this step. In order to not diverge from their data pool we chose to drop 0 options, this is reflected in \autoref{table:tableB1}. 

Further data is included in \autoref{app:lvl1}. 


\subsection {Level 2 Filters}

\paragraph{Methodology}

The Level 2 filters comprised of: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Days to Maturity $<$7 or $>$180}: To filter out options with less than a week to expiration (due to erratic price behavior) or more than 180 days to expiration (due to low liquidity).
  \item \textit{IV $<$5\% or $>$100\%}: To filter out options with extreme IV values.
  \item \textit{Moneyness $<$0.8 or $>$1.2}: To filter out options with extreme moneyness values, due to these options having low liquidity and little value beyond the intrinsic value of the option.
  \item \textit{Implied Interest Rate $<$0}: To filter out options with negative implied interest rates, which are likely due to quoting errors. To calculate the implied interest rate, we compute the put-call parity implied interest rate using each option pair's bid-ask midpoints as the price. The put-call parity implied interest rate is the interest rate that makes the put-call parity equation hold.

\begin{equation}  
  \begin{align}
    C-P &= S-Ke^{rT} \\
    e^{rT} &= \frac{(S-C+P)}{K} \\
    r &= \frac{1}{T} \cdot \log\left(\frac{S-C+P}{K}\right)
  \end{align}
  \label{eq:pcpIntRate}
\end{equation}

  \item \textit{Unable to compute IV}
\end{itemize}


an ``Identical'' filter, to filter out duplicate options in the OptionMetrics data (measured by identical option type, strike, expiration date, and price), and an ``Identical Except Price'' filter (the ``IEP filter''), which aimed to filter out options identical in all respects except price. In these cases, the paper's authors retained options whose quoted T-bill-based IV was closest to its moneyness neighbors, and deleted the rest.

\subsection{Level 3} 

The Level 3 filters described in the paper are not as straightforward as the previous two levels, and are comprised of an implied volatility filter (the ``IV filter'') and a put-call parity implied interest rate filter (the ``put-call parity filter'', or ``PCP filter''). In particular, the intricate construction of these filters, and the lack of specific details regarding filter parameters in \citet{constantinides2013}, make the filtered option counts highly sensitive to changes in the filter parameters. Furthermore, since the IV filter and the PCP filter are applied sequentially, errors in replication get compounded downstream. 

Since the Level 3 filters were more complex, for the 

\subsubsection{IV Filter}

The objective of the IV filter was to reduce the prevalence of apparent butterfly arbitrage. A butterfly arbitrage occurs when there is a discrepancy in the IV structure across difference moneyness levels for options having the same expiration date. The construction of the IV filter involved multiple fitting a quadratic polynomial to the observed log volatilities, the and filtering out options whose implied volatilities

\section{Replicating Table2}
\autoref{tab:t2} describes how many options are found, go missing, or expire in the dataset. An option is found if it reappears the next trading day. An option is missing for if it does not reappear the next trading day. Multiple days missing, counts as multiple options missing. Lastly, if an option is lost and expires this is noted as expired. 

We would like to note an interesting aspect of the \STARTONE\ to \ENDONE\ dataset. Over 80\% of the options expire on a Saturday or a non-trading day. To handle this, we push the expiration day to the nearest Friday, presumably the nearest trading day. However, there are quite a few edge cases which would explain the discrepancy between our analysis and \citet{constantinides2013}. Further investigation is required. A short summary of the day distribution is given in \autoref{table:T2days}. 

%To implement this table we use pandas market calendars to produce an array of NYSE trading days. We then assign an integer to each day and merge this to our dataframe. To determine the time an option is lost, we use a relative distance argument and take differences using the integers. This is much faster than subtracting datetime objects with conditionals on if we're getting a trading day. adf

\section{Conclusion} 

Our findings illustrate that seemingly straight forward instructions for filtering data may lead to divergent results. To reduce these errors, we suggest that journals require that computationally intense manuscripts, such as \citet{constantinides2013}, publish their code base along with their findings. Our data acquisition is briefly described in \autoref{app:data}, and our code base can be found our \href{https://github.com/harrypandas/finm-32900_final_project.git}{Github} \footnote{ \url{https://github.com/harrypandas/finm-32900_final_project.git} }.

\section{Data}\label{app:data}

Our option data is queried from OptionMetrics provided by Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). We limit the query to SECID = 108105, S\&P 500 Index - SPX. We use the three month Tbill as our interest rate, this is from the Federal Reserve Board's H15 report supplied by WRDS. 

In comparison to their data, we have pulled 184 more options than them. It is unclear where the discrepancy lies. We assumed we were off by a day however this will truncate or elongate the dataset by over 300 points. We credit the discrepancy to OptionMetrics updating their data to be more accurate.

\autoref{table:time1lvl1T1} and \autoref{table:time2lvl1T1} illustrate that many of the options in the initial and post filtering dataset have no trading volume nor open interest. Importantly, but perhaps not unexpectedly, nearly half of the options in the \STARTONE\ to \ENDONE\ dataset have no trading volume, and around 20\% of options in this dataset have no open interest. The impact of these options in the portfolios of \citet{constantinides2013}, if they are not filtered out of the final analysis, are unclear to us and merits further investigation.
